## The Question Every CTO Gets

"Should we use blockchain for this?"

After building multiple production blockchain systems, here's my framework for answering that question.

## The Decision Matrix

Use blockchain when **all three** are true:

1. **Multiple parties need to verify the same data**
2. **Trust boundaries exist** (parties don't fully trust each other)
3. **Audit trail is critical** (immutability matters)

If any of these is false, use a database.

## Real Examples

### ✅ Good Use Case: Multi-Party Settlement

**Problem:** Three companies need to track shared transactions without a central authority.

```
Company A <-> Shared Ledger <-> Company B
                  |
              Company C
```

- Multiple parties: ✅
- Trust boundaries: ✅
- Audit trail critical: ✅

**Solution:** Private blockchain (Hyperledger, Polygon CDK, or consortium chain)

### ❌ Bad Use Case: User Authentication

**Problem:** Need to store user login credentials.

- Multiple parties: ❌ (just your system)
- Trust boundaries: ❌ (you control everything)
- Audit trail: Not primary concern

**Solution:** PostgreSQL + proper security. Don't overcomplicate.

## Cost Analysis

Blockchain is **expensive**. Here's what you're paying for:

| Operation | Traditional DB | Blockchain | Multiplier |
|-----------|---------------|------------|------------|
| Write | $0.001 | $0.50 | 500x |
| Read | $0.0001 | $0.01 | 100x |
| Storage/GB/mo | $0.10 | $50+ | 500x+ |

These costs are **not academic**. At scale, they're brutal.

## The 3-Question Filter

Before implementing blockchain, ask:

### 1. Can I use a signed database log instead?

```typescript
// Often this is enough
interface SignedEntry {
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
  signature: string; // ECDSA signature
  previousHash: string;
}
```

If a signed, append-only log solves your problem, do that instead.

### 2. Who actually needs decentralization?

Be honest: Do your users care? Or is this "blockchain for blockchain's sake"?

### 3. What happens when gas fees spike?

In 2021, Ethereum gas hit $200+ per transaction. If your business model breaks at high gas prices, rethink the approach.

## When to Actually Use It

**Treasury Management** — Multiple signers, high-value transactions, full audit trail.

**Cross-Organization Data Sharing** — No trusted central party exists.

**Supply Chain with Adversarial Parties** — Need verifiable provenance across untrusted actors.

**Tokenized Assets** — When you actually need composability with DeFi or secondary markets.

## Implementation Reality Check

Building production blockchain systems requires:

- **3x longer development time** vs traditional systems
- **Specialized security review** (smart contract audits aren't optional)
- **Operational complexity** (key management, gas price monitoring, node infrastructure)
- **Different failure modes** (immutability can be a bug when you need to fix things)

## Final Framework

```
START -> Multiple parties? -> No -> Use PostgreSQL
          | Yes
       Trust boundaries? -> No -> Use PostgreSQL
          | Yes
       Audit critical? -> No -> Use PostgreSQL
          | Yes
       Can justify 10-500x cost? -> No -> Use signed logs
          | Yes
       -> Blockchain might be right
```

## Conclusion

Blockchain is a powerful tool **when you need it**. Most systems don't.

The best engineering decision is often the simplest one that meets requirements.
