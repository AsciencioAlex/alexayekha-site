## Overview

Building a secure crypto treasury requires balancing accessibility with security. This guide covers the practical engineering decisions for production-grade treasury infrastructure.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Multisig Everything** — No single point of failure
2. **Defense in Depth** — Multiple security layers
3. **Observability First** — Know what's happening in real-time
4. **Incident Response** — Plan for compromise

## Hot vs Cold Wallet Strategy

### Hot Wallet (Operational)
- Holds 5-10% of total treasury
- 2-of-3 multisig minimum
- Automated monitoring & alerts
- Rate limiting on withdrawals

```typescript
interface HotWalletConfig {
  signers: Address[];
  threshold: number;
  dailyLimit: BigNumber;
  cooldownPeriod: number; // seconds
}

const operationalWallet: HotWalletConfig = {
  signers: [DevOps, Finance, CTO],
  threshold: 2,
  dailyLimit: parseEther("50"),
  cooldownPeriod: 3600, // 1 hour
};
```

### Cold Wallet (Long-term Storage)
- 90-95% of treasury
- 3-of-5 or 4-of-7 multisig
- Hardware wallet signers
- Quarterly access reviews

## Monitoring & Alerts

Set up real-time monitoring for:

- **Unexpected transactions** — Any tx not initiated through your system
- **Balance changes** — Track inflows/outflows
- **Gas price anomalies** — Detect potential attacks
- **Signer changes** — Alert on ownership modifications

```typescript
async function monitorTreasury(address: Address) {
  const balance = await provider.getBalance(address);
  const threshold = parseEther("1000");
  
  if (balance.lt(threshold)) {
    await alert("Treasury balance below threshold", {
      current: formatEther(balance),
      threshold: formatEther(threshold),
    });
  }
}
```

## Incident Response Plan

When compromise is suspected:

1. **Freeze operations** — Pause all automated systems
2. **Secure remaining funds** — Emergency transfer to backup wallet
3. **Investigate** — Analyze transaction history, check signer security
4. **Communicate** — Internal team + stakeholders
5. **Post-mortem** — Document and improve

## Key Takeaways

- Never compromise on multisig for production treasuries
- Monitoring is not optional — you need real-time visibility
- Test your incident response before you need it
- Separate hot/cold wallets based on operational needs
